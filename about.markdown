## Welcome to New Log+

### Me

Hi! I'm Graeme, and I am **not (_yet_)** a game developer.
I'm a senior software developer with a **passion for games** and a background in both tech and the arts.
Breaking into game dev is part of what **NL+** is for (the other parts are learning, and fun).

**Journey 1**: I spec'd into an **arts build**. Went to theatre school, got the degree, stint in Japan, then back to the hub. At that point I respec'd to a **science build**, this time going in for a computer science degree. I've been following that path ever since.

**Journey 2**: I aim to change this up with another respec, only this time I'll run a **quality build**: game development. 

So that's what I'm doing here. Learning C++ and Unreal, tinkering with gameplay ideas, consuming all of [Sakurai's educational content], working on my own game design document, and documenting it all here.

### "New Log+"?

The title **"New Log+"** is about starting out on a new journey, about increasing the difficulty, and about pushing yourself.

Also, I thought it was fun. :)
