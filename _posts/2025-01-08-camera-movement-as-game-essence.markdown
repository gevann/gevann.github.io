## So I had a thought...

Most of the games that I play are 3D, third-person, and most of those have a free-movement camera. Though there are a few that don't (I'm looking at you _[The Last Guardian]_).

It came to me the other day that the thing I do most when gaming is move the character. I'm almost always using the left stick to do _something_. The amount of left-stick inputs I throw out dwarfs the inputs for attacking, blocking, dodging, interaction, whatever else. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, there's also all the [schmovement] available in many, many games. This led me to a realization that there is another input I do almost as much as moving: **adjusting the camera**.

Moving has a ton of [game essence] added to it: dashes, sprints with stamina management, roll, crouch and creep, slow-walk, run, strafe, jump. I'm sure this is nowhere near a complete list (rocket jumps, etc), but there's definitely a lot of thought put into give the player agency in movement, and imbuing it with **game essence** -- running in for a faster approach puts you in the danger zone with more limited stamina, less options for retreats. Learning that moment and animation cancel so you can change directions 180 degrees much faster provides an edge in Splatoon, the reward for the effort of learning a niche move.

To me this makes sense - these are 3D games and what is unique about them from an input-POV is two thumbsticks. One is you-the-character's movement, the other is where you-the-player viewing. I believe that there is a drastic difference in the amount of gameplay designed each of these, and that by bringing the same level of gameplay design to camera control we could make something unique and enthralling. After all camera-movement has to be the second most common input in these types of games.

So that's what I'll be experimenting with next.
